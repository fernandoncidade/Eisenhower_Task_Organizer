   The Software is distributed as an installer/executable for Windows. The end user does not need to install Python or additional libraries to run the Software; development dependencies are packaged in the executable.

3. LICENSE GRANT
   Subject to the terms of this License, the Licensor grants the Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Software according to the acquired modality (free or commercial).

4. USAGE RESTRICTIONS

   - The Software stores tasks locally in the tasks.json file in the user's persistent path (e.g., AppData). There is no automatic transmission of data to external servers.
   - The Software offers export (XLSX, PDF, JSON) and import (XLSX, PDF). Exported files are saved in the location chosen by the user.
   - Accessibility and compliance resources designed for store distribution (e.g., Microsoft Store) are documented in the installer and in the "MS-Store-ADA-v8.9-FINAL-EN.pdf" file included in the package.

6. THIRD PARTIES
   The Software incorporates third-party components subject to their own licenses. License texts and a list of third-party components accompany the installer and are available for consultation in the distribution package. Use of these components is subject to their respective licenses.

7. UPDATES AND SUPPORT
   The Licensor may, at its sole discretion, provide updates or fixes. Technical support and update terms depend on the acquired license modality (see the Commercial Agreement when applicable).

8. LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIABILITY
   - The Software is provided "AS IS," without express or implied warranties, except for applicable legal warranties.
   - To the extent permitted by law, the Licensor shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential damages, or lost profits resulting from the use or inability to use the Software.
   - Where direct liability is admitted by law, compensation will be limited to the amount paid for the Software (when applicable) or R$ 5.00, whichever is greater.

9. PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION
   - Data generated by use of the Software (e.g., tasks.json and exported files) remain under the user's control.
   - The Licensor declares not to collect automatic telemetry via the standard executable. Any processing of personal data will follow the Privacy Policy included in the package.

10. TERMINATION
    This License may be terminated for violation of its clauses. After termination, the Licensee must cease use and remove the executable as applicable.

11. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
    This License shall be governed by Brazilian law. For dispute resolution, the court of São José dos Pinhais, State of Paraná, Brazil, is elected.

12. ACCESSIBILITY STATEMENT
    For distribution in digital stores, accessibility documentation ("MS-Store-ADA-v8.9-FINAL-EN.pdf") has been prepared. Inclusion of this document does not alter the limitations of liability in this License; reports of accessibility barriers should be communicated to the support channels indicated in the installer.

13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
    This License, together with the Privacy Policy and third-party license documents included in the installer, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the Software.
