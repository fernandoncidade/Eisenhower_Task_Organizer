Third-Party Software Licenses and Attributions Notice

This document lists the main third-party libraries used in the EISENHOWER ORGANIZER project and references to their licenses. The purpose is to comply with distribution requirements (including LGPL compliance for Qt/PySide6 libraries) and provide information for users and integrators. Project dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file included in the repository/installer.

General information about PySide6 (Qt for Python) — LGPL compliance
- Library: PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- License: GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v3 (or according to the packaged PySide6 version)
- Version used (see requirements.txt): PySide6 6.x (as packaged in the installer)
- Replacing LGPL libraries:
  - PySide6 libraries are distributed as dynamic libraries (DLLs) in the installer/executable.
  - To replace PySide6 DLLs, locate the installation/instance folder containing the PySide6 binaries and replace the corresponding DLL files with compatible versions.
  - If you want the source code corresponding to the PySide6 version used in the executable, it is publicly available at:
    https://github.com/qt/pyside
  - If you have difficulty obtaining compatible source code or binaries, request instructions via the support channels provided in the installer/distribution.
