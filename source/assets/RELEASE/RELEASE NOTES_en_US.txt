NOTES: Version 0.0.8.0
Date: January 15, 2026

Main new features and improvements:
- Improved internationalization and date/time formatting:
  - Translation manager with safe installation and removal of translators (includes trying to load Qt translations).
  - Dynamic application of QLocale according to the selected language; date formats adjust automatically (includes handling years with 'yyyy').
  - Language-change signals propagated to components that show date/time (calendar popup, date/time edit dialog, inputs).

- "About" dialog and Release Notes integrated:
  - "About" window updated to show embedded release notes and multiple tabs (History, Details, Licenses, Notices, Privacy Policy and Release Notes).
  - Header updated to version 0.0.8.0 and improved runtime retranslation.

- Manual viewer redesigned and navigable:
  - Manual shown in a non-modal dialog with a list of sections and anchor-linked view.
  - Section navigation, preservation of the current position when changing language, and mapped positions for quick jumps.
  - Visual improvements: relative font sizes, emphasized titles and support for the application icon.

- Task date/time editing and rendering:
  - Date/time edit dialog applies locale to the calendar popup and time edit; correct synchronization between "Link date" and "Link time".
  - Task display updates tooltip with formatted date/time, preserves base text and avoids orphaned time headers.
  - Insert/remove item operations use signal blocking and cleanup of time groups to avoid inconsistent states.

- Interface and shortcuts:
  - Settings menu rebuilt: checkable language entries, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+M for calendar, Ctrl+Shift+M for manual, F1/Help for About, Alt+A/I/O to open menus) with proper context.
  - Safe removal of old shortcuts before creating new ones, reducing conflicts.

- Time controls:
  - CustomTimeEdit with continuous minute wrapping behavior (smoother minute navigation).
  - TimeEdit receives a consistent display format and updates when the language changes.

- Robustness, logging and exception handling:
  - Expanded logging and exception handling at critical points (translation, file loading, UI updates), making diagnosis easier without crashes.

Important fixes:
- Fixed the version number shown in the "About" dialog (now 0.0.8.0).
- Fixes for dynamic application of Qt translations and searching for system .qm files, avoiding silent failures when translations are not present.
- Prevents incorrect placeholders and lists with non-selectable items when inserting/editing tasks.
- Prevents loss or duplication of tasks when moving between lists: operations block signals and consistently update calendar and persistence.
- Fixes for UI updates when changing language at runtime (dialogs, default buttons, labels and menus).
- Fixes for calendar popup behavior and displayed date/time formats.
- Fixes for crashes when opening the Manual repeatedly (dialog reuse and focus) and when navigating anchors.

Notes:
- Changes focus on usability, localization and robustness; no file format or save mechanism was changed.
- The app continues to operate offline — no data is sent to external servers.
- For diagnostics, check the logs in the user's persistence directory.

- Improvements in the interface module (incore_01_initUI.py):
  - Friendlier date and time fields: formats adjust automatically to the language and the time control allows continuous minute scrolling, making it easier to pick times.
  - Synchronization between "Link date" and "Link time": unchecking the date automatically disables the time to avoid inconsistent entries.
  - Translated context menus: copy/cut/paste and similar menus appear in Portuguese when the language is set, providing a more consistent experience.
  - Better visual and accessible feedback: main buttons (Add Task, Calendar) get icons when available and clear placeholders are shown in lists and completed lists.
  - Stability when moving and editing tasks: events between lists are handled to avoid item duplication or loss and to keep the calendar synchronized.
  - Expanded robustness and logging: sensitive operations (applying locale, language changes, signal connections) have error handling and logs to help diagnosis without crashing the app.
  - Context and organization of lists: quadrants and completed lists were reinforced with predictable behaviors and custom context menus for task actions.

Module-specific fixes:
- Automatic adjustment of the date format to use a four-digit year when applicable.
- Avoids silent errors when applying translations and updating date/time components at runtime.
- Ensures time controls are only enabled when appropriate (date linked) to prevent invalid entries.

RELEASE NOTES: Version 0.0.6.0
Date: December 22, 2025

Main new features and improvements:
- Counting badges in the calendar: the calendar now displays small balloons (badges) in the top-right corner of days that have tasks, showing how many tasks are linked to that date.
- Counters by day, week and month: in addition to per-day counts, the calendar keeps aggregated counts by week and by month, accessible via the widget API (public methods to retrieve counts).
- "Native" border around the calendar: the QCalendarWidget is now wrapped by a container that draws the native Qt frame (QStyle::PE_FrameLineEdit). The border automatically follows the system theme (light/dark) via Qt's palette.
- Automatic integration with tasks: when the task list is updated (additions, removals or edits), the calendar's badges and highlights are refreshed automatically.
- Adaptive colors: badges use native palette colors (QPalette.highlight / highlightedText), ensuring good visibility in both light and dark themes.
- Visual highlighting of dates with tasks: dates that have tasks remain highlighted (semi-transparent background) and now coexist with badges.
- Reuse between dialog and panel: both the calendar dialog and the side panel use the badge widget and share the same logic for collecting/filtering tasks and visual updates.
- Robustness and logging: initialization, painting and update operations are protected with exception handling and logging, reducing visible errors for users and easing diagnosis.

Important fixes:
- Consistent visual updates: fixes cases where the calendar did not immediately reflect changes in the task list (badges and highlights are now updated whenever the list changes).
- Border responsive to theme changes: the frame now redraws correctly when switching between system light and dark modes.
- Prevents incorrect badge drawing: badge size and position have been adjusted to fit correctly within cells, avoiding text overlap.

Notes:
- The new frame is drawn by Qt (QStyle::PE_FrameLineEdit) to keep appearance consistent with other controls (e.g., QLineEdit).
- If you want to show week/month counters in the UI, the methods already exposed in the widget allow retrieving them for additional use.
- No save behavior or file formats were changed; this release focuses on visual improvements and synchronization between lists and the calendar.
