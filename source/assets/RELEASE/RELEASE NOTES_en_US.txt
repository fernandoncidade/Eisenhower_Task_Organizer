RELEASE NOTES: Version 0.0.7.0
Date: January 12, 2026

Main features and improvements:
- Localization and date/time format improvements: the date/time component respects the active locale (via the translation manager) and automatically adjusts displayed formats.
- Updated text and display of the "About" dialog: version 0.0.7.0 and release notes integrated into the dialog for direct access.
- Task rendering enhancements: tooltips with date and time, base text preserved, and more consistent formatting when updating lists.
- More reliable integration with the calendar panel: lists and badges are updated automatically when tasks are added, edited, or removed.
- Refined time-based grouping and time group management: avoids orphan/duplicated headers and maintains stable ordering of time-tagged tasks.

Important fixes:
- Fixed visual update issues in lists and calendar (badges, highlights, and placeholders).
- Robustness: expanded exception handling and logging to reduce user-visible failures.
- Adjustments to placeholders and non-selectable item behavior to prevent incorrect placeholders.

Notes:
- Changes focused on usability and robustness; no file format or saving mechanism was changed.
- App continues to operate offline — no data is sent to external servers.

RELEASE NOTES: Version 0.0.6.0
Date: December 22, 2025

Main new features and improvements:
- Counting badges in the calendar: the calendar now displays small balloons (badges) in the top-right corner of days that have tasks, showing how many tasks are linked to that date.
- Counters by day, week and month: in addition to per-day counts, the calendar keeps aggregated counts by week and by month, accessible via the widget API (public methods to retrieve counts).
- "Native" border around the calendar: the QCalendarWidget is now wrapped by a container that draws the native Qt frame (QStyle::PE_FrameLineEdit). The border automatically follows the system theme (light/dark) via Qt's palette.
- Automatic integration with tasks: when the task list is updated (additions, removals or edits), the calendar's badges and highlights are refreshed automatically.
- Adaptive colors: badges use native palette colors (QPalette.highlight / highlightedText), ensuring good visibility in both light and dark themes.
- Visual highlighting of dates with tasks: dates that have tasks remain highlighted (semi-transparent background) and now coexist with badges.
- Reuse between dialog and panel: both the calendar dialog and the side panel use the badge widget and share the same logic for collecting/filtering tasks and visual updates.
- Robustness and logging: initialization, painting and update operations are protected with exception handling and logging, reducing visible errors for users and easing diagnosis.

Important fixes:
- Consistent visual updates: fixes cases where the calendar did not immediately reflect changes in the task list (badges and highlights are now updated whenever the list changes).
- Border responsive to theme changes: the frame now redraws correctly when switching between system light and dark modes.
- Prevents incorrect badge drawing: badge size and position have been adjusted to fit correctly within cells, avoiding text overlap.

Notes:
- The new frame is drawn by Qt (QStyle::PE_FrameLineEdit) to keep appearance consistent with other controls (e.g., QLineEdit).
- If you want to show week/month counters in the UI, the methods already exposed in the widget allow retrieving them for additional use.
- No save behavior or file formats were changed; this release focuses on visual improvements and synchronization between lists and the calendar.

RELEASE NOTES: Version 0.0.5.0
Date: 21 December 2025

Key improvements and features:
- Drag-and-drop reliability: improvements to avoid invalid moves (does not allow dropping on the same list; ignores non-selectable items).
- Safer processing: signals are blocked during drag-and-drop operations to prevent duplicate events.
- Auto-save and synchronization: the task list is automatically saved after drag-and-drop and the calendar pane is updated immediately.
- Consistent actions and indicators: default drop action set to copy and drop indicator improved for more predictable behavior.
- Improved logging and error handling: more informative logs and exception handling to reduce crashes visible to the user.

Important fixes:
- Prevents task loss when moving items between lists.
- Ignores drag-and-drop operations with no valid items, avoiding inconsistent states.
- Improved visual updates of lists and the calendar after moves.

Notes:
- The application continues to operate offline — no data is sent to external servers.
- Auto-save remains active; update to apply the drag-and-drop and stability improvements.

RELEASE NOTES: Version 0.0.4.0
Date: 21 December 2025

Key improvements and features:
- Time grouping: tasks with a time now appear grouped by hour range (e.g., 09:00–09:59) within each quadrant, making it easier to view the day.
- Improved ordering: tasks are sorted by time first and then by text to help you find items quickly.
- Drag-and-drop support: move tasks between quadrants and between completed lists intuitively using drag-and-drop.
- Improved date/time edit dialog: easier to reset or remove a task's date and time; options respect the application's locale date/time format.
- More comfortable time inputs: time control uses wrapping behavior for smoother minute navigation.
- Calendar pane integration: the side calendar panel remains integrated and automatically updates the task list when items change.
- Localization and formats: better language support and automatic adjustment of date/time formats based on the selected language.
- Usability: refinements to labels, placeholders and context menus (move task, reset date, remove) for a clearer workflow.

Important fixes:
- Automatic removal of empty time headers to avoid orphaned items in lists.
- Fixes to prevent task loss when moving/editing items and improved error handling for common operations.
- Small adjustments to keep placeholders consistent when lists become empty.

Notes:
- The application continues to operate offline — no data is sent to external servers.
- Auto-save remains active; please update to apply the new ordering and grouping to your tasks.
