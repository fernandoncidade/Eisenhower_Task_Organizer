RELEASE NOTES: Version 0.0.5.0
Date: 21 December 2025

Key improvements and features:
- Drag-and-drop reliability: improvements to avoid invalid moves (does not allow dropping on the same list; ignores non-selectable items).
- Safer processing: signals are blocked during drag-and-drop operations to prevent duplicate events.
- Auto-save and synchronization: the task list is automatically saved after drag-and-drop and the calendar pane is updated immediately.
- Consistent actions and indicators: default drop action set to copy and drop indicator improved for more predictable behavior.
- Improved logging and error handling: more informative logs and exception handling to reduce crashes visible to the user.

Important fixes:
- Prevents task loss when moving items between lists.
- Ignores drag-and-drop operations with no valid items, avoiding inconsistent states.
- Improved visual updates of lists and the calendar after moves.

Notes:
- The application continues to operate offline — no data is sent to external servers.
- Auto-save remains active; update to apply the drag-and-drop and stability improvements.

RELEASE NOTES: Version 0.0.4.0
Date: 21 December 2025

Key improvements and features:
- Time grouping: tasks with a time now appear grouped by hour range (e.g., 09:00–09:59) within each quadrant, making it easier to view the day.
- Improved ordering: tasks are sorted by time first and then by text to help you find items quickly.
- Drag-and-drop support: move tasks between quadrants and between completed lists intuitively using drag-and-drop.
- Improved date/time edit dialog: easier to reset or remove a task's date and time; options respect the application's locale date/time format.
- More comfortable time inputs: time control uses wrapping behavior for smoother minute navigation.
- Calendar pane integration: the side calendar panel remains integrated and automatically updates the task list when items change.
- Localization and formats: better language support and automatic adjustment of date/time formats based on the selected language.
- Usability: refinements to labels, placeholders and context menus (move task, reset date, remove) for a clearer workflow.

Important fixes:
- Automatic removal of empty time headers to avoid orphaned items in lists.
- Fixes to prevent task loss when moving/editing items and improved error handling for common operations.
- Small adjustments to keep placeholders consistent when lists become empty.

Notes:
- The application continues to operate offline — no data is sent to external servers.
- Auto-save remains active; please update to apply the new ordering and grouping to your tasks.
